# Welcome to Bangazon!
Bangazon is an e-commerce site which allows users to buy and sell products as well as complete their orders and cancel them.

## Navigating Bangazon 
Before a user has logged in, they are able to view products available in the marketplace. They are also able to search for products using the search bar in the navigation as well as check which products have local delivery available. If the user has logged in, they will be able to sell a product and view that product in the marketplace afterward. They can add any product to their cart using the add to cart icon or by clicking on the 'Add to Cart' button on the product detail page. The product detail page is available through the detail icon, or by clicking on the products image. 

The user can view their profile details by navigating to their user image and clicking on the 'My Profile' affordance. Within their profile, they can add and delete payment types. The user can view the products they have added to their cart by clicking on the 'My cart' affordance. They can also browse additional products to add to their cart from the page. Additionally, users can view their orders and cancel their order through the 'My Orders' affordance. Once their order is cancelled, all relationships between that order and its products will be deleted as well as the order itself. The user can navigate to browse more products in the marketplace or view their shopping cart through the available buttons. When the user has completed their marketplace process, they can feel free to log out.
